    "body": "## Why rituals matter\nCadences that bind discovery, delivery, and analytics keep teams oriented toward the same outcomes. I share the planning templates that helped me reset direction at Varahe Analytics.\n\n### Weekly focus reviews\nI use a lightweight business review that forces teams to connect user insights with roadmap bets. It reduces handoffs and spotlights when experiments stall.\n\n### Quarterly operating narrative\nEvery quarter I assemble a narrative that ties metrics, learnings, and roadmap shifts. It prevents thrash and keeps leadership, sales, and engineering aligned.",

It unlocks where to double down before adoption dips.\n\n### Co-designing guardrails\nPlaybooks die when governance is bolted on later. I co-design guardrails with data engineers and programme owners so experimentation stays safe.\n\n### Let experiments graduate\nWe retire experiments explicitly so the backlog never becomes a graveyard. It keeps stakeholders confident that analytics work ties back to revenue and mission goals.",
